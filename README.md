<h4 align="center">Message from ShareAc Developer</h4>

  <p align="center">
This project is a clone of the original WeFlix by DUOCODIES. There were many changes made to the initial code.<br>
  The project was migrated from manifest 2 to manifest 3 to support latest web browsers and latest security compliances. This version supports a wide variety of website to share the session without the need of credentials. The initial code was revamped and made efficient to make the extension more lightweight than earlier.
