  <p align="center">
This project is a copy of DUOCODIES's original WeFlix. The original code underwent a lot of changes.<br>
To support the most recent web browsers and security compliances, the project was moved from manifest version 2 to manifest version 3.
This version enables the sharing of sessions across a large number of websites without the need for login credentials.
The original code was improved upon and made more effective in order to make the extension lighter than before.
